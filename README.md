# Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe

####This is a javascript program of ultimate tic-tac-toe.  I programmed the AI using a breadth first search with game theory to prune bad branches.
#####The game graphics and rules are from someone elses code, I used it as a framework to develop the AI.
####The heuristics are based on:
1. valuing overal number of squares owned
2. number of big squares owned
3. number of potential 3-in-a-rows
4. number of potential big 3-in-a-rows (potential wins)
